# Blockchain Credit Report
A blockchain can provide anonymity for credit reports because no personal identifying information is stored within the smart contract.

Consumers as well as subscribers (creditors and collectors) are identified by their wallet address hash.

Credit report items are defined as private contract variables.

Fair Credit Reporting guidelines are followed by allowing the consumer unlimited, free access to their own report, while subscribers are charge a small fee for each inquiry.

Only a subscriber can add a new consumer when a new report item is added.

Only a consumer can create a dispute while a subscriber can finalize and update a dispute. 

The contract owner can poll disputes and delete any disputes that have been opened for longer than thrty days.

# The Future of Blockchain
Blockchain technologies is NOT a new technology, but a twist on an old technology, repackaged in different wrapping. Blockchain uses RPC or remote procedure calls, which is as old as myself. The abilities of blockchain are reminensent of the ole CORBA days which refers to common object-oriented request broker architecture. Unlike CORBA, blockchain is expensive to use because of the gas fees. A better blockchain would be to eliminate the gas fees? and the mining?

Blockchain is easier to implement than CORBA.
