# Blockchain Credit Report
A blockchain can provide anonymity for credit reports because no personal identifying information is stored within the smart contract.

Consumers as well as subscribers (creditors and collectors) are identified by their wallet address hash.

Credit report items are defined as private contract variables.

Fair Credit Reporting guidelines are followed by allowing the consumer unlimited, free access to their own report, while subscribers are charge a small fee for each inquiry.

Only a subscriber can add a new consumer when a new report item is added.

Only a consumer can create a dispute while a subscriber can finalize and update a dispute. 

The contract owner can poll disputes and delete any disputes that have been opened for longer than thrty days.
